# Zombies Ate My Neighbors autosplitter

This is an autosplitter for ZAMN on snes9x. The timer starts approximately when the first frame is started on the game, allowing you to sync up w the bazooka on the -22.16 timer.

You can use the [google spreadsheet to check what frame you're opening the garbage can on](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBesJyanOXi1_-RiOxdYUVrKBGV9_sAfNaUr5KghGTQ/edit#gid=0https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBesJyanOXi1_-RiOxdYUVrKBGV9_sAfNaUr5KghGTQ/edit#gid=0) and adjust to get the bazooka.

## TODO
- Make split on each level
- make emulator support more robust
- verify using best address to start timer
